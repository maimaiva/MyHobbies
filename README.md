## MyHobbies

### AVID RUNNER

"Marathon took me out of my comfort zone. It gave me a sense of accomplishment. I grow stronger and become more endurance and confident. "

### AMATEUR HOME BARISTA

"Coffee is the mixture of art and science. Different beans, different methods give different tastes and sensations. I love to explore the world of coffee. Also, I love to make myself a unique cup of coffee everyday."

### PLANT LOVER

"Taking that brief moment to look away from your screen and spend time to take care of little plants is soothing and relax. This activity completely cut me out from the chaotic world."
